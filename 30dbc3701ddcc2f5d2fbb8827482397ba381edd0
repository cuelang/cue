      "message": "That would be possible, I think. For the shared tests it would be\n\n_golden/testname/path\n\nbut the same technique applies I reckon. As this automatically validates golden, though, I probably need to be more explicit by writing a new file. Or I have to parse the result from the write back to figure out which files in the archive I have to compare (note there is also a preamble with errors). So it does require a bit more work.",
