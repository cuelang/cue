      "message": "That would be possible, I think. For the shared tests it would be\n\n_golden/testname/path\n\nbut the same technique applies I reckon. As this automatically validates golden, though, I probably need to be more explicit by writing a new file. Or I have to parse the result from the write back to figure out which files in the archive I have to compare (note there is also a preamble with errors). So it does require a bit more work.",

      "message": "Up to you - I agree golden files are a bit more work, but I\u0027ve found that they\u0027re nicer to work with in the long run. You can also keep multiple files closer together, like:\n\n-- f1.cue --\nxxx\n-- f1.cue.golden --\nxxx\n-- f2.cue --\nyyy\n-- f2.cue.golden --\nyyy\n\n\nYou could also have a special file for the preamble with errors, like preamble.golden, or errors.golden, or stderr.golden.\n\nIf you don\u0027t feel like doing this refactor here, perhaps we can file a wishlist-like issue on github.",
