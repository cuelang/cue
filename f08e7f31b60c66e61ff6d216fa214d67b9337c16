      "message": "I\u0027m not following this. If you do the unification here as written (that is, without normalization) you get\n\n   {a:1,b:2} | _|_ | {a:1,b:2}\n\nwhich after dropping bottom and deduping gives\n\n   {a:1,b:2}\n\nwhich is the same answer you get with normalization. I don\u0027t see how you ever get _|_.\n\n\nThat said, I think normalizing disjunctions is a good idea in general. There is no reason why a config should fail if it generates {a:1} | {a:1,b:2}, when that is just a verbose way of writing {a:1}. Saying \"disjunctions are normalized\" also subsumes the rules for dropping bottom and deduping, simplifying the spec.\n\n[sorry, this comment is in the wrong CL...]",

      "message": "It\u0027s a little surprising that \"float | 1\" means \"float \u0026 1\" when I use it as an operand. For that reason alone, I would hold off on treating all elements as marked if none are until there are very clear advantages. I don\u0027t think saving one character by writing \"1 | int\" instead of \"*1 | int\" is worth it.",
