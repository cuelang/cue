Or is the thinking here to remove them and re-add them when we come to better define what `cuerun` and `cue test` will do? Because I can imagine needing something like `TestCUEFiles` and `XTestCUEFiles` for `cue test`, as well as `ToolCUEFiles` if only to distinguish the fact that we might force (per our discussions) tools to be declared in a separate `_tool` package (like external tests in Go).",
