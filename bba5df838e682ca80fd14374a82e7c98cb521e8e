      "message": "When I first saw injection, one thing that initially \"bit\" me was the I didn\u0027t need to address the \"tag\" namespace when providing a value via injection. That is to say, I declare a tag vi:\n\n    @tag(blah)\n\nand provide a value via -t blah\u003dhello. i.e. I don\u0027t use the word \"tag\" anywhere in setting the value of the blah tag.\n\nFor some reason my brain was expecting to have to do so, especially because the wording:\n\n    \"The injection mechanism allows values to be injected into fields that are marked with a \"tag\" attribute\"\n\nseems to suggest that \"tag\" is a particular type of attribute.\n\nHowever, there is no \"tag namespace\" or type of attribute at all, just a global set of attributes.\n\nI mention that now because we now have the \"build\" attribute. So again my brain thought that there would be a separate \"namespace\"/type for the build attributes.\n\nHowever, as I understand it, that\u0027s not the case, indeed the following should be possible:\n\n\n    @build(prod)\n\n    @tag(prod,type\u003dbool)\n\nI think we should clarify this somewhere/somehow. Thoughts?",
