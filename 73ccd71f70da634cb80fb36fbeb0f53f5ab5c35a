      "message": "The order constraint is perhaps a bit restrictive here. We\u0027re used to the requirement to put the package clause and import declarations at the start, but I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m keen about this new restriction. The last declaration in the file is the least visible. Certainly with structs, I\u0027ve sometimes wanted to put the `...` at the start of the struct so it\u0027s obvious. How about allowing any number of `...` directives at any position in a source file and within a struct?",

      "message": "Yes, I was thinking to do the same ultimately. This can even help as hints to the topological sort where items should be added. This change would be quite substantial, though. To be consistent, that change would also have to be be applied to structs.\n\nSo this is a temporary measure to improve consistency. This in turn, allows JSON Schema generation to be the same at the file and struct level and allows moving things around without breaking things.",
