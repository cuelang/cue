# The CUE Configuration Language

_Configure, Unify, Execute_

CUE is an open source configuration language which aims
to make complex configurations more manageable and usable.

CUE is a constrained-based language.
Constraints provide a powerful yet simple alternative
to inheritance, a common source of complexity
with other configuration languages.

The CUE tooling also provides integrated declarative scripting
aimed at simplifying putting configurations to good use while
giving static analysis tools maximum domain knowledge.

Some highlights:

- JSON superset: get started quickly
- convert existing YAML and JSON
- declarative scripting
- automatically simplify configurations
- formatter
- arbitrary-precision arithmetic
- rich APIs designed for automated tooling
- a formalism conducive to automated reasoning
- generate CUE templates from source code
- generate source code from CUE configurations (TODO)


### Download and Install

#### Install From Source

If you already have Go installed, the short version is:

```
go get -u cuelang.org/go/cmd/cue
```

This will install the `cue` command line tool.

### Learning CUE

A demonstration of how to convert and restructure an existing
set of Kubernetes configurations is available in
[written form](./doc/tutorial/kubernetes/README.md).
