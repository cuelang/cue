-- foo/bar.cue --

foo: string

"foo-bar" :: int

Incompatible definitions detected:

A trick that can be used is to rename this to a regular identifier and then
move the definition to a sub field. For instance, rewrite

			"foo-bar" :: baz
			"foo\(bar)" :: baz

		to

			#defmap: "foo-bar": baz
			#defmap: "foo\(bar)": baz

Errors:
cannot convert dynamic definition for '"\(foo)"':
    ./foo/bar.cue:3:1
invalid identifier "foo-bar"; definition must be valid label:
    ./foo/bar.cue:6:1
--- foo/bar.cue
package bar

"\(foo)" :: int
foo:        string

"foo-bar" :: int
