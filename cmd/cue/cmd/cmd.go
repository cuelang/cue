func newCmdCmd(c *Command) *cobra.Command {
	cmd := &cobra.Command{
		Use:   "cmd <name> [inputs]",
		Short: "run a user-defined shell command",
		Long: `cmd executes defined the named command for each of the named instances.

Commands define actions on instances. For example, they may specify
how to upload a configuration to Kubernetes. Commands are defined
directly in tool files, which are regular CUE files within the same
package with a filename ending in _tool.cue. These are typically
defined at the top of the module root so that they apply to all
instances.

Each command consists of one or more tasks. A task may load or
write a file, consult a user on the command line, fetch a web page,
and so on. Each task has inputs and outputs. Outputs are typically
filled out by the task implementation as the task completes.

Inputs of tasks my refer to outputs of other tasks. The cue tool does
a static analysis of the configuration and only starts tasks that are
fully specified. Upon completion of each task, cue rewrites the instance,
filling in the completed task, and reevaluates which other tasks can
now start, and so on until all tasks have completed.

Available tasks can be found in the package documentation at

	https://pkg.go.dev/cuelang.org/go/pkg/tool?tab=subdirectories

Examples:

In this simple example, we define a command called "hello",
which declares a single task called "print" which uses
"tool/exec.Run" to execute a shell command that echos output to
the terminal:

	$ cat <<EOF > hello_tool.cue
	package foo

	import "tool/exec"

	city: "Amsterdam"
	who: *"World" | string @tag(who)

	// Say hello!
	command: hello: {
		print: exec.Run & {
			cmd: "echo Hello \(who)! Welcome to \(city)."
		}
	}
	EOF

We run the "hello" command like this:

	$ cue cmd hello
	Hello World! Welcome to Amsterdam.

	$ cue cmd --inject who=Jan hello
	Hello Jan! Welcome to Amsterdam.


In this example we declare the "prompter" command which has four tasks....

	package foo

	import (
		"tool/cli"
		"tool/exec"
		"tool/file"
	)

	city: "Amsterdam"

	// Say hello!
	command: prompter: {
		// save transcript to this file
		var: file: *"out.txt" | string @tag(file)

		ask: cli.Ask & {
			prompt:   "What is your name?"
			response: string
		}

		// starts after ask
		echo: exec.Run & {
			cmd:    ["echo", "Hello", ask.response + "!"]
			stdout: string // capture stdout
		}

		// starts after echo
		file.Append & {
			filename: var.file
			contents: echo.stdout
		}

		// also starts after echo
		print: cli.Print & {
			contents: echo.stdout
		}
	}
