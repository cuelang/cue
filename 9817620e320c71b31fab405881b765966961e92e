It\u0027s all a little odd because it seems like we\u0027re not just mapping CUE syntax on the left to the non-CUE syntax for defaults on the right.\n\nWhen you say \"for any marked disjunction `a`\" below, that seems to imply that the single letter term \"a\" _can_ match a marked disjunction, but it seems that it can\u0027t below.\n\nThis confusion is probably all my own, but could possibly use a word or two of extra explanation.",

But at least in for both the RHS and LHS we are _not_ matching CUE, but rather the abstract notion of a value-with-an-optional-default pair.\n\nOne could say that the CUE `a | *b` translates to the abstract pair of `(a | b, b)`.\n\nSo in CUE, a single letter can indeed match a marked disjunction.
