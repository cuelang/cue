      "message": "Have you described what things a single term \"v\" can match? I think I know what you\u0027re getting it, but I don\u0027t see anything that says that \"v\" can\u0027t also match (v, d) which would seem to make these rules ambiguous. It\u0027s all a little odd because it seems like we\u0027re not just mapping CUE syntax on the left to the non-CUE syntax for defaults on the right.\n\nWhen you say \"for any marked disjunction `a`\" below, that seems to imply that the single letter term \"a\" _can_ match a marked disjunction, but it seems that it can\u0027t below.\n\nThis confusion is probably all my own, but could possibly use a word or two of extra explanation.",
