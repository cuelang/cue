My test was with a matrix with a single entry. We will have to define three jobs: start, test and end. That way, as you point out the start notification will be once, at the start, any failures will notify from each test that fails, and the end once at the end if all tests pass.\n\nThe if always() is required to always run this step regardless of job state.",
