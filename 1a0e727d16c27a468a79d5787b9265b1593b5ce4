      "message": "Using equals is fine in an API, but not mid-evaluation in CUE. As I said, we probably want to limit this for scalar values, at least for now.\n\nEquals is a pretty intense operation. For non-concrete values it returns structural equivalence. I don\u0027t know what the implications are of doing this mid-evaluation. This is also there reason why \u003d\u003d is not defined on lists and structs. Maybe builtins could return an \"incomplete\" error, but also here I don\u0027t know what this means. TBH, I wouldn\u0027t even know what equality means if both structs are concrete at the moment! (considering openness, definitions, hidden fields, etc.) This should wait until the builtin error model has crystalized a bit and we have a better understanding of equality for structs and lists in general.\n\nFor now, though, we could say that it is an error to use these functions if a list uses structs or lists. We can then later make it more specific.",

      "message": "Thanks for the more elaborate input. I\u0027m going to change it so that the element is first checked if it\u0027s a scalar value and if not return an error. Also their are other functions like contains which also use this function. Maybe we need to implement checks for these as well.",
