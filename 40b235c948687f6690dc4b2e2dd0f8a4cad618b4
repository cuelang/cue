The first line sets up a constraint which the default in the second line fulfills.\n\nNow consider\n```\na: \u003e\u003d5 | int\na: * 5 | int\n```\nThis doesn\u0027t change anything; the result is still 5. Both definitions give the same answer.\n\nNow consider\n```\na: * \u003e\u003d5 | int\na: * 5 | int\n```\nThe only difference here is that the first line has a preference for values \u003e\u003d 5, rather than a hard requirement as in my first example. It still seems to me that 5 is the best answer. These two constraints probably came together from two different configs, combined. Both configs will take any int for `a`. One config prefers that `a` is at least 5; the other has a more definite preference for exactly 5. It is hard to see why either config would be unhappy with 5. But the existing definition does not resolve `a`, leaving it at `\u003e\u003d 5`. The user would get an error at emit time, and I think they would be puzzled, since when they examine the config they will see a default of 5, with nothing contradicting that.",

For the first you get\n\n   {a:1}\n\nimmediately, and for the second you get\n\n   {a:1} \u0026 {a:1}\n\nwhich is {a:1}.\n\nThere is no normalization in this definition. Normalization is a syntactic operation which tries to put an expression in a form closer to its true lattice point without changing its default. I\u0027m saying that for the definition at least, don\u0027t talk about syntax. Talking about marks syntactically doesn\u0027t seem to work out right. So never do algebra with marks. Instead, when it\u0027s time to actually get an answer (figure out which lattice point an expression denotes), examine the expression as a whole, semantically. First remove the unmarked parts, and see if that denotes something. If it does, you have a usable default value, so use it. If it doesn\u0027t, the marks are not helping, so erase them and see what you have.\n\nThe spec doesn\u0027t care how you implement this. It\u0027s giving only the semantics. The reason I think you can get away with not having an algebra for marks is that you have a completely functional language, so you never really have to simplify or reduce any expression until it\u0027s time to actually turn it into a concrete value.\n\n\"Inside\" each of the two steps of my definition -- the \"drop unmarked\" step and the \"erase marks\" step -- you have an expression with no marks. In that context you can use mark-free algebra to simplify. That doesn\u0027t require normalization, just the commutativity, associativity and distribution of \u0026 and |.\n\nSo let\u0027s look at this example again:\n\n  a: * \u003e\u003d5 | int\n  a: * \u003c\u003d5 | int \n\nWhen it\u0027s time to emit a, you get\n\n   (* \u003e\u003d5 | int) \u0026 (* \u003c\u003d5 | int)\n\nUsing my definition, first drop the unmarked elements and see what you get:\n\n    \u003e\u003d5 \u0026 \u003c\u003d5\n\nThat evaluates to (denotes) 5, so that is your answer.\n\nNote that in my definition you never encounter  \u003e\u003d5 | \u003c\u003d5, which I agree denotes int.\n\nIf instead the expression was\n\n   (* \u003e\u003d5 | int) \u0026 (* \u003c\u003d4 | int)\n\nthen dropping the unmarked elements results in bottom, so the marks are erased and the result is\n\n   (\u003e\u003d5 | int) \u0026 (\u003c\u003d4 | int)\n  \u003d int \u0026 int\n  \u003d int",

(v1, d1) \u0026 (v2, d2) is (v1\u0026v2, d1\u0026d2). Note that as v1\u0026v2 subsumes d1\u0026d2, the subsumption property is preserved without requiring any additional definitions. During manifestation, d is taken if it is not bottom, otherwise v is taken.\nA unification of x1 and x2 succeeds if v1\u0026v2 is not bottom.\n\nSyntactically, default values can be introduced with disjunctions, where the value pair is (all disjuncts, marked disjuncts) if a disjunctions has marks or (all disjuncts, all disjuncts) otherwise.\n\nI think this gives exactly the properties you want. It is trivially clear that default values will become more specific after unifying any two values. For instance, (int, \u003c\u003d5) \u0026 (int, \u003e\u003d5) \u003d\u003e (int, 5). Also (1|2) \u0026 (*1|2) becomes (1|2, 1|2) \u0026 (1|2, 1) \u003d\u003e (1|2, 1).\n\nIt also, except for syntax, completely separates the notion of defaults from disjunctions. Normalization of disjunctions is now a matter separate from normalization of default values. For instance, (\u003e\u003d5 | int, \u003e\u003d5 | 10) can trivially be normalized to (int, \u003e\u003d5) without having to worry about marks and what they mean.\n\nIn general, one could (roughly) view evaluation now as doing two evaluations in parallel using regular unification, without worrying about the concept of defaults. Sort of like the AMT tax, but picking the best option instead of the worst, and more fun. :)",

No need to talk about normalization in conjunction with defaults (as in your proposal) or rules for how marks carry over. Markers are only used to relate syntax to semantics, but are not involved at all in resolution itself. Operations on defaults can be defined in terms of binary expressions, instead of considering a sequence of disjuncts in its entirety. The latter always made me a bit squeamish.\n\nI think this writeup is semantically equivalent to your proposal, but as I find reasoning about markers quite tricky, I am not sure.\n\nIt may be good to also mention the rules of subsumption, which we do not do now.  \nRules of subsumption are quite easy\n\n- (v2, d2) ⊑ (v1, d1)  if v2 ⊑ v1 and d2 ⊑ d1\n- (v1, d1) ⊑ v         if v1 ⊑ v (note that by definition d1 ⊑ v1, so d1 ⊑ v1 ⊑ v)\n- v ⊑ (v1, d1)         if v ⊑ d1\n\nthe last one is so restrictive as v could still be made more specific by associating it with a default that is not subsumed by d1. Proof: \nby definition for any d ⊑ v, it holds that (v, d) ⊑ v, where the most general value is (v, v).\nGiven the subsumption rule for (v2, d2) ⊑ (v1, d1), from (v, v) ⊑ v ⊑ (v1, d1) it follows that v ⊑ d1 exactly defines the boundary of this subsumption.\n\nI\u0027m not sure about the noop rule, but had to pick something.\n\n *(a | *b) | (c | *d) \u003d\u003e (a|b|c|d, b|d) // not (a|b|c|d, a|b|d)\n *(a | *b) | c        \u003d\u003e (a|b|c, b)\n  (a | *b) | *c       \u003d\u003e (a|b|c, b|c)\n\nseems reasonable, but variants are possible. Maybe not ideal, but it is a simple rule.\n\nNote that defaults are preserved across references:\n\n a: int | *1\n b: a | *2   \u003d\u003e (int|1|2, 1|2) \u003d\u003e (int, 1|2)\n\nAlso note:\n\n a: int | *1\n b: int | *2\n c: a \u0026 b \u003d\u003e int | *_|_ (note the importance of the the last term)\n d: c | *3 \u003d\u003e (int| _|_ |3, _|_ | 3) \u003d\u003e (int, 3)\n\nAll seems quite reasonable.\n\nPeople will get funky. For instance, to discard a default:\n\n a: int | *1       // (int, 1)\n b: a \u0026 (_ | *_|_) // set default to bottom (int, 1) \u0026 (_, _|_) \u003d\u003e (int, _|_)\n c: b | *2         // set new default: (int, _|_) | (2, 2) \u003d\u003e (int|2, _|_|2) \u003d\u003e (int, 2)\n d: b | *b         // allow any default again in unification \u003d\u003e (int, int)\n\nor just\n\n c: (a \u0026 (_|*_|_)) | *2\n\nor\n\n ClearDefault \u003d *_|_ | _  // need to ensure formatter adds spaces to *_|_|_ :)\n c: ClearDefault\u0026a | *2\n\nAll not that great, but as far as abuse goes, it could be worse (one cannot set a new default for an existing field, of course, as it will be unified right back in).",

In this example, {a:1} is equivalent to the result, and it would be weird and logically wrong to treat it differently.\n\nWithout the interaction with defaults, this could arguably be seen as an implementation detail. But I think it is good to at least informally remark on it, for example by leaving this paragraph in possibly rephrasing it as:\n\nA disjunction is _normalized_ if there is no element\n`a` for which there is an element `b` such that `a ⊑ b`.\nA disjunction literal must be normalized, where marked elements are exempted from this rule as long as a disjunction defined by multiple marked disjuncts is itself normalized.\n\nThis rephrasing is a bit longer, but decouples the notion of normalization of disjunctions from markers and default values. The first sentence could be in the section of disjunction, whereas the second sentence could be put in the section about defaults. Notice the distinction here between disjunctions (the concept) and disjunction literals, where the latter allows markers defining default values whereas these are irrelevant to the former.\n\nThe second sentence forbids code like:\n\na: float | 1.0\nb: float | *\u003c\u003d5.0 | *1.0\n\netc. which seems like a good idea, as this will likely be an error and there is no good use for such definitions otherwise.",
