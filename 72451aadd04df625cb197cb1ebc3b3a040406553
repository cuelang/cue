      "message": "My immediate sense is to not make this change. Reason being, there are a number of different knobs that can be tweaked in the configuration of the pprof sampling:\n\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/runtime\n\n(specifically the \"Rate\" related variables/functions)\n\nAlso this change only considers CPU profiling; when there is also memory profiling (heap/allocs), goroutine, threadcreate, block and mutex:\n\nhttps://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof#Profile\n\nSo we would end up needing a relatively involved \"interface\" to setting which profiles we want, various options etc. I\u0027m not clear that we need/want to expose that for cmd/cue.\n\ngo test already provide a subset of that interface for CPU and memory profiling (go help testflag)\n\nLet\u0027s shift discussion of this to an issue in any case, so that others can contribute thoughts too.\n\nTony - are you happy creating an issue to continue this thread?",
