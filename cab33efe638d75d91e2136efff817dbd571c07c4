      "message": "The copied code from encoding/json is tricky. In order to do proper tag resolution one essentially has to implement field disambiguation as it is done in Go from scratch. For years I have wanted to implement a Go package to support doing so, as essentially any package like `json`, `xml`, etc, need to do this from scratch.\n\nAs for now it is copied and heavily modified.\n\nI do expect some bugs. But at least it fixes a whole bunch of issues related to the round tripping.",
