      "message": "I think for Sum it is fine to take 0. If you think about it, Sum would be reducing x+y with an initial value of 0. \n\nFor Min and Max one would have to return an infinite number, which seems base, and for Avg you get a div by 0. So an error is fine there.\n\nBut I think returning 0 for Sum is useful.\n\nProduct could be 1 for empty lists by the same reasoning, although that seems slightly stranger. I\u0027m ambivalent there.",
