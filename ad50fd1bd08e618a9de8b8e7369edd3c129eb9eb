Will be an easy fix.\n\nNote, btw, that multiple comprehensions in a list are now supported, so you could write\n\n  _All: [\n   [ for _, F in _OnceFiles { F } ],\n\n   [ for _, F in _BuiltinModelFiles { F } ],\n  ]\n\nas:\n  _All: [\n   for _, F in _OnceFiles { F },\n   for _, F in _BuiltinModelFiles { F },\n  ]\n\nThis can also be intermingled with normal elements, if, and ...\n\nThe idea is also to disallow using + for list concatenation as it is rather confusing (will the result be closed or not, etc.)",
