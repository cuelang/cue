      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that this is a sufficiently representative example. The case where this presented itself in a `gopkg.in` path, of the form `gopkg.in/foo.v1`. In that example, we want `foo` to be the package identifier, not `v1`, but here from the rest of the changes, it looks like it\u0027ll probably choose `v1`. FWIW gopkg.in paths are specifically recognised by the go tool, so it\u0027s probably worth getting this right (similar to `/vN` suffixes).",
