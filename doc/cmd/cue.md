# `cue` command reference

`cue help` gives information about the various `cue` commands available, as well
as additional help topics. For example `cue help import` gives information about
how to convert other formats like JSON and YAML to CUE, and `cue help filetypes`
describes the `cue` command's support for various file types.

We do plan to provide a web-based version of these various help topics,
something that is tracked by https://github.com/cuelang/cue/issues/9.
