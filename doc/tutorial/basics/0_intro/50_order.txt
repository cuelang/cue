CUE's basic operations are defined in a way that the order in which
you combine two configurations is irrelevant to the outcome.

This is crucial property of CUE
that makes it easy for humans _and_ machines to reason over values and
makes advanced tooling and automation possible.

-- order.cue --
a: {x: 1, y: int}
a: {y: 2, x: int}

b: {x: int, y: 2}
b: {y: int, x: 1}

-- expect-stdout-cue --
a: {
    x: 1
    y: 2
}
b: {
    x: 1
    y: 2
}
