JSON objects are called structs in CUE.
An object member is called a field.


Double quotes may be omitted from field names if their name contains no
special characters and does not start with a number:

-- json.cue --
one: 1
two: 2

// A field using quotes.
"two-and-a-half": 2.5

list: [
	1,
	2,
	3,
]

-- expect-stdout-cue --
{
    "list": [
        1,
        2,
        3
    ],
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
    "two-and-a-half": 2.5
}
