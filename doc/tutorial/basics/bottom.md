_Types ~~and~~ are Values_

# Bottom

Specifying duplicate fields with conflicting values results in an error
or bottom.
A _bottom_ is a special value in CUE, denoted `_|_`, that indicates an
error such as incompatible values.
Any error in CUE results in `_|_`.
Logically all errors are equal, although errors may be associated with
metadata such as an error message.

Note that an error is different from `null`: `null` is a valid JSON value,
whereas `_|_` is not.
