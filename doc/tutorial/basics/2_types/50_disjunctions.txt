Disjunctions, or sum types, define a new type that is one of several things.

In the example, `conn` defines a `protocol` field that must be one of two
values: `"tcp"` or `"udp"`.
It is an error for a concrete `conn`
to define anything else than these two values.

-- disjunctions.cue --
Conn :: {
    address:  string
    port:     int
    protocol: "tcp" | "udp"
}

lossy: Conn & {
    address:  "1.2.3.4"
    port:     8888
    protocol: "udp"
}

-- expect-stdout-cue --
Conn :: {
    address:  string
    port:     int
    protocol: "tcp" | "udp"
}
lossy: {
    address:  "1.2.3.4"
    port:     8888
    protocol: "udp"
}
