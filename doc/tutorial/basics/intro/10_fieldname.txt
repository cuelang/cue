JSON objects are called structs in CUE.
An object member is called a field.


Double quotes may be omitted from field names if their name contains no
special characters and does not start with a number:

-- fieldname.cue --
{
    one: 1,
    two: 2,

    "two-and-a-half": 2.5
}

-- expect-stdout-cue --
{
    "one": 1,
    "two": 2,
    "two-and-a-half": 2.5
}
