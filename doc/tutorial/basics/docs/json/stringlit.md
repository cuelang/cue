CUE strings allow a richer set of escape sequences than JSON.

CUE also supports multi-line strings, enclosed by a pair of triple quotes `"""`.
The opening quote must be followed by a newline.
The closing quote must also be on a newline.
The whitespace directly preceding the closing quote must match the preceding
whitespace on all other lines and is removed from these lines.

Strings may also contain [interpolations](interpolation.md).
