# "Raw" Strings

CUE does not support raw strings in the strictest sense.
Instead it allows modifying the escape delimiter by requiring
an arbitrary number of hash `#` signs after the backslash by
enclosing a string literal in an equal number of hash signs on either end.

This works for normal and interpolated strings.
Quotes do not have to be escaped in such strings.

msg2: ##"""
    A regular expression can conveniently be written as:

        #"\d{3}"#

    This construct works for bytes, strings and their multi-line variants.
