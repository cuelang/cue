The public API now exposes the entire `attr.Content` as a string, so we could write a custom parser, but it seems better to be consistent with CUE\u0027s implementation.\n\nThe spec talks about balanced brackets (https://cuelang.org/docs/references/spec/#attributes), but it\u0027s unclear if that is implemented yet. (it looks like a TBD from what I can tell)",
